First off all:
pip install pygame in the terminal window
Why did we installed pygame??
We installed pygame because we need the mixer from the pygame that will play a song

We didnt use playsound because if we used playsound, the tkintr gui would stopped responding, so thats why

then copy paste all the code. or download the code. and then thats it!!
